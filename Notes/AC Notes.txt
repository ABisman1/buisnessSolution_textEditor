Modern air conditioning was invented in 1902 by Willis Carrier, who developed a system to control humidity and temperature for a Brooklyn printing plant. Originally designed to prevent paper from wrinkling, this "apparatus for treating air" was patented in 1906, launching the modern cooling industry, leading to commercial adoption in theaters by the 1920s.
